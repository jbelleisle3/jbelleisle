    This is a full year course, that meets every day block four. It’s it there responsibility to build parts for NASA Machines. At the end of the year these students will go to Texas on a Hunch field trip, to the Huston Space Station. </p>

We are the only school in New Hampshire certified with NASA. 
Past projects
A few years ago Nasa wanted new mechanical pencils that would work in space, and wouldn’t have a high chance of floating away. Our students designed this pencil, and was brought and Used in the ISS. 
    At the beginning of this year, Governor Maggie Hassan, and many other congress members came to the high school, to tour the shop and talked about the NASA project.  </p>
