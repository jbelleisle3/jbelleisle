They have class on block 5 white days.\r\nMachine tool 1\t(picture of group)\r\nThese kids are starting to build projects and are one year away\r\nMachine tool advanced (picture of group)\r\n\tThis is a full year course, that meets every day block four. It’s it there responsibility to build parts for NASA Machines. At the end of the year these students will go to Texas on a Hunch field trip, to the Huston Space Station. \r\n\r\nSIDE SCREEN\r\nThe NASA Hunch project’\r\nThese students are certified!\r\nDr. Florence Gold (Flo) is our NASA contact. \r\n  The nasa hunch project is where High school students are United involved with Nasa to Create Hardware. \r\nOur high school students are building three parts for flight single storage lockers.  (picture)\r\nBases-\r\nPictures of the progress for all three\r\nStuds- \r\nNuts-\r\nThe process to build these parts in a delicate one. The students have to fill out documentation forms, on every part they make. They then have to create a blueprint of each one to follow. They have many machines to use, to cut and form these parts. After that they file them down, package them and send them out to NASA. \r\n\r\nIt started with practice hardware, NASA was so impressed they asked the \r\nWe are the only school in New Hampshire certified with NASA. \r\nPast projects\r\nA few years ago Nasa wanted new mechanical pencils that would work in space, and wouldn’t have a high chance of floating away. Our students designed this pencil, and was brought and Used in the ISS. \r\n\tAt the beginning of this year, Governor Maggie Hassan, and many other congress members came to the high school, to tour the shop and talked about the NASA project.  \r\n",
